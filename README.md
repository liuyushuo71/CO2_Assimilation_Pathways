# About
The pipeline was written and tested with Python 3.12. The core libraries essential for the pipeline including: Cobra, Pandas, equilibrator_api, and related packages.
# Installation
1.create CO2_pathways environment using conda:
```bash
conda create -n CO2_pathways python=3.12
```
2.install related packages using pip:
```bash
pip install cobra
pip install equilibrator_api
pip install equilibrator_pathway
```
# Steps to reproduce the analysis
```bash
cd /file path/project save path/
